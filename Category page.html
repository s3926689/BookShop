                <p>Reading strengthens your brain
                A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your mind.
                Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmedTrusted Source that\
                reading involves a complex network of circuits and signals in the brain. 
                As your reading ability matures, those networks also get 
                stronger and more sophisticated.
                In one studyTrusted Source conducted in 2013, researchers used 
                functional MRI scans to measure the effect of reading 
                a novel on the brain. Study participants read the novel 
                “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As tension built in the 
                story, more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity.
                Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and 
                for days afterward, brain connectivity increased, especially 
                in the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that responds 
                to physical sensations like movement and pain.</p>
