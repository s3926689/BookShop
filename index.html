                    <p>A picture book combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format,
                        most often aimed at young children.
                        With the narrative told primarily through text,
                        they are distinct from comics, which do so primarily through
                        sequential images. The images in picture books can be produced in a
                        range of media, such as oil paints, acrylics, watercolor, and pencil.</p>

                    <p>Early reader books are considered the "earliest" 
                        chapter book a child can experience. Broken up 
                        into smaller chapters, early readers are a great 
                        way to boost confidence in young readers. While 
                        they are mostly read from the ages 5-9, early readers
                         can be enjoyed by anyone!</p>

                    <p>Chapter Books
                        For young and new readers, books tend to be very short. 
                        They are made up of just words or a few short sentences. 
                        They are primarily very picture heavy and have a simple, linear story.
                        Chapter books are the next stage for readers. Chapter books 
                        are stories that are long enough and complex enough to require 
                        chapters to break them up. At a young age, they are not too long; 
                        they are shorter than novels but longer than typical picture books.</p>

                        <p>An atlas gets its name from the Greek god Atlas, 
                            who, according to myth, was forced to bear the 
                            weight of the heavens on his shoulders. 
                            You might feel like Atlas if you have to carry 
                            one of these books around. Atlases are usually 
                            large, oversized books that contain maps, diagrams, 
                            and information such as population figures. 
                            Traditionally, atlas refers specifically to a
                             bound book of maps rather than to a folding map, 
                             a globe, or an online database.</p>

                <p>Reading strengthens your brain
                A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your mind.
                Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmedTrusted Source that\
                reading involves a complex network of circuits and signals in the brain. 
                As your reading ability matures, those networks also get 
                stronger and more sophisticated.
                In one studyTrusted Source conducted in 2013, researchers used 
                functional MRI scans to measure the effect of reading 
                a novel on the brain. Study participants read the novel 
                “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As tension built in the 
                story, more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity.
                Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and 
                for days afterward, brain connectivity increased, especially 
                in the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that responds 
                to physical sensations like movement and pain.</p>
